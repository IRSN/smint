	* Fixed error in 'gridInt.R' using 'dimnames' with a bad object.

2015-08-18  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Changed NAMESPACE to add imports suggested by CRAN check
	results.

2015-08-14  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Changed a few words in 'smintGuide'.

	* Changed the code of the c function 'grid_int' to remove the
	SETLENGTH statement, likely conflicting with the garbage
	collector. Rather than a temporary vector 'f' with changing
	length, we now use a temporary list of numeric vectors with
	different lengths.

2015-06-04  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Renamed the package as 'smint' instead of 'mint' because the
	later is no longer available for use on the CRAN.

2015-05-19  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Removed the functions 'GridInt' and GridIntCB' from the exported
	objects in NAMESPACE. These functions still exist (unchanged) in
	the package, but are now to be used through 'interp_Grid' only.

	* Changed the 'interp_Grid' function and its documentation. 

	* Changed the 'mintGuide' document which is now used via 'knitr' and
	no longer via 'Sweave'.

2015-05-13  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Renamed the format 'nxEsp' of 'randGrid' as 'nxE'. 

	* Small changes in doc: \url changed in \href to avoid long
	strings that can not be hyphenised in the pdf manual. Added
	missing methods the doc of the "Grid" class.

	* Re-compiled the documents 'mintGuide.pdf' 'CompDet.pdf' in
	inst/doc with the due change for the renamings. These documents
	are now compatible with the current version of 'mint'.

	* Renamed 'cheschinoInt' into 'interp_ceschino' and 'roundLevels'
	into 'round_levels'.
	
2015-05-12  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Changed some text for the help files.

	* Added a preliminary version of 'interp_Grid' (with no examples
	yet).

	* Changed the DESCRIPTION file to conform to CRAN: Title style for
	the 'Title', sentences in 'Description'. Added the authors of
	Fortran codes.

	* Renamed the "GridData" class into "Grid", 'rGrid' into
	'randGrid', *CB into cardBasis_*, 'GD*' into '*_GD'. Subsequent
	changes in the doc with renaming of the .Rd files.
		

2015-02-27  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Added NAMESPACE

	* Removed mutiple dispatch for 'checkX' and 'closest'.
	
2015-02-26  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Added GD* functions for 'GridData' management.

	* Removed the allocations of arrays in 'splinterp.f' and
	'alterp.f'.
	

2015-02-20  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Implemented the interfaces to 'QSHEP2D' and 'QSHEP3D'.

	* GridData management: changed some names to GD*, added 
	a function to find boundary points, range, ...
	
	* Corrected some bugs or errors in the documentation.
	

2015-02-11  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* BUG FIX. 'rMax' was passed as integer to the subroutine
	'sheppint', with no consequence on input but caussin a meaningless
	value to be returned.

	
2014-11-14 Yves

	* Added the C implementation of 'gridInt'. This is done by 
	using the .Call interface.
	
	* Added the 'gridIntCB' function and its doc, along with
	some Cardinal Basis constructor: 'lagrangeCB', 'ceschinoCB' and
	'natSplineCB'.
 
	* Completed the document 'Computing Details'.
	
	
2014-10-12 Yves
	
	* Added a 'closest' method dispatching on two arguments 'XNew'
	and 'X'.

	* Changed the order of the formal in 'checkX' and turned this 
	function into a S4-generic to dispatch on arguments.

	* Fixed a bug in the nOut > 1 case in GridInt.
		 
	
2014-04-08  Yves

	* Removed unneccessary duplications of big arrays in the code of
	'gridInt'. 

	* Added (with changed name) a formal to specify the interpolation
	order in 'gridInt'.

2014-04-02  Yves 

	* Improved the dimnames for the 'index' slot in GridData objects.

	* Added tests functions and their documnetation: 'branin' (copied
	from DiceKriging) 'ShepFun1', ... 'ShepFun5'.

	* Removed the 'setGeneric' for existing builin which created some
	problems.

	* Fixed some errors in 'setGeneric' (bad names).
	

2014-03-29  Yves
 
	* 'gridInt' function for grid interpolation using an arbitrary
	interpolation method.
 
	* Added a S4 class "GridData" and some methods fot it. This class
	and its methods can be used to produce test data with pretty few
	lines of code. See examples in the documentation of the methods.
