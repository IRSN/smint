Description: Smooth multivariate interpolation for gridded and scattered data
    with possibly large datasets. The code for scattered data is taken from the
    'SHEPPACK' Fortran package by W.I. Thacker, J. Zhang, L.T. Watson, 
    J.B. Birch, M.A. Iyer and M.W. Berry (2010) <doi:10.1145/1824801.1824812>, 
    which is distributed under non-commercial use under ACM
    (see <https://github.com/vtopt/sheppack> for commercial enquiries). 
    The code of the Ceschino interpolation method coming from A. Hebert (2013) 
    <doi:10.5772/23252>, is licensed under LGPL (version>=2.1).
